Project to make a Generative Adverserial Network to mouse a simulated mouse pointer as humanly as possible.

The idea is to mouve a mouse from A to B in the most human-like fashion. 

This is part of a larger project to help me automate farming in a video game, without being caught. 

A GAN consists of a generator and discrimantor. 
The generator tries to move the mouse as human-like as possible.
The discriminator tries to detect weather this was a human or bot movement.

Both AIs will keep improving themselves in an endless cycle.

1# Training data

A key part of this process will be having usable training data.
I, myself, believe I am a human being and thus I move my computer mouse as human-like as possible. 
I have small imperfactions, hand acceleration and deceleration, even tiny jitters. 
A bot would move in a perfectly straight, optimal line. 

My plan is to record my mouse movements using a program, then save them and label them. 

I can use the pyinput library to capture mouse input.
I will also use the "time" and "csv" libraries to save that input periodically.
